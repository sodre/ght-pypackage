Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `{{ cookiecutter.project_repo }}` for local development.

1. Fork the `{{ cookiecutter.project_repo }}` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/{{ cookiecutter.project_repo }}.git

3. Install your local copy into a conda environment. Assuming you have conda installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ cd {{ cookiecutter.project_repo }}/
    $ make init
    $ conda activate {{ cookiecutter.project_repo }}-dev
    $ pip install -e . --no-deps

4. Create a branch for local development, use the ``f-``, ``i-`` or ``chore-`` prefixes to auto-label your PR::

    $ git checkout -b (f|i|chore)-name-of-your-contribution

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass black, flake8 and coverage
   tests::

    $ make format lint test

   All the dependencies should already be included in your conda environment.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin (f|i|chore)-name-of-your-contribution

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should pass all our GitHub tests.

Tips
----

To run a subset of tests::

    $ pytest tests.test_{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}

Deploying
---------

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.
Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in HISTORY.rst).
Then run::

$ bump2version patch # possible: major / minor / patch
$ git push
$ git push --tags

Travis will then deploy to PyPI if tests pass.
